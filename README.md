## iOS 101: Lab - Unit 1 - Mario Kart (Gestures & Animations)

### ðŸŽ¯ Goals

By the end of this lab I was able to...

2. Understand and implement basic gesture recognizers in Swift
3. Animate views using UIKit
4. Build familiarity with Swift syntax and Appleâ€™s documentation

### ðŸš€ Features

#### âœ… Required Features

1. Double-tapping a kart animates it off the screen
2. Rotating a kart using two fingers turns the kart
3. Pinching a kart using two fingers enlarges or shrinks the kart
4. Panning the kart moves it based on the gestureâ€™s location
5. Long-pressing the background resets the karts' positions and states
6. Animate all karts to their starting positions **at once** when the app launches
7. Animate the karts to their starting positions **one at a time** when the app launches
8. Race all karts at the same speed
9. Race all karts at randomized speeds

### ðŸ›  Notes

- I only modified sections of the code as explicitly instructed in the project comments and lab instructions.
- This lab helped me get comfortable working in Xcode and exploring Swift features through hands-on implementation.
